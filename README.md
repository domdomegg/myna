## Development

You need [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to run the dev server. If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) you can do the following:

```sh
brew install hugo
```

Check this [Hugo installation page](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for installing on other systems.

Then clone the repo, install dependencies, and start the server locally.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/praveenjuge/myna.git
cd myna
npm install
npm start
```

Open [`http://localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in your browser.
